Title:
Enhancing Utility Weather Station Network Measurements by Identifying Discrepancies With North American Mesoscale Data and Polygon Optimization

Abstract:
To ensure that Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) are effectively implemented when necessary, it is crucial to obtain accurate wind speed readings. Weather station data serves as the ground truth, while NAM forecasts provide an additional reference to evaluate and confirm those readings. However, discrepancies between these sources can create uncertainty in critical decision-making, highlighting the need for a systematic approach to assess and address these inconsistencies. Previous research has used forecasting models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, to identify inconsistencies between model predictions and weather station measurements. However, these studies have not focused on pinpointing specific locations with significant discrepancies. This paper aims to conduct a geospatial analysis and apply loss functions to identify North American Mesoscale (NAM) points with large wind speed errors compared to wind speed measurements from SDG&E weather stations. Since error measurements can only be accurately determined for points within VRI polygons, we utilized the LightGBM model to predict the error of NAM points located outside these polygons. Additionally, we seek to refine the VRI polygon boundaries by analyzing polygons with high NAM point discrepancies. Specifically, we will perform an in-depth evaluation of NAM points within these polygons and propose the closest alternative VRI polygons that reduces overall discrepancies. In general, our approaches enable the identification of locations where additional wind speed data should be collected and improve accuracy when executing wildfire mitigation strategies.
