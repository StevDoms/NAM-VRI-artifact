Title:
Wind Speed Discrepancy Analysis and VRI Polygon Optimization with NAM Data

Abstract:
With the increasing occurrence of wildfires throughout Southern California, Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) are one of SDG\&E's crucial strategies to mitigate wildfires. The decision to conduct a PSPS is based on weather station readings, particularly wind speeds. Each weather station is associated with a VRI polygon, representing an area where the stationâ€™s readings are assumed to uniformly reflect the local wind conditions. To ensure that PSPS is effectively implemented when necessary, it is crucial to obtain accurate wind speed readings. Previous research has used forecasting models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, to identify inconsistencies between model predictions and weather station measurements. However, these studies have not focused on pinpointing specific locations with significant discrepancies. This paper aims to conduct a geospatial analysis and apply loss functions to identify North American Mesoscale (NAM) points with large wind speed errors compared to wind speed measurements from SDG\&E weather stations. Since error measurements can only be accurately determined for points within VRI polygons, we utilized the LightGBM model to predict the error of NAM points located outside these polygons. Additionally, we seek to refine the VRI polygon boundaries by analyzing areas with high NAM point discrepancies. Specifically, we will perform an in-depth evaluation of these boundaries and propose alternative VRI polygons that minimize these errors. Furthermore, newly optimized polygon boundaries will enable a more nuanced assessment of PSPS in a given area. This approach enables the identification of locations where additional wind speed data should be collected to enhance the accuracy of the implementation of the PSPS.
